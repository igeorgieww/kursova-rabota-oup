      <h1>Challenger's History</h1>
      <p>
        The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of
        automobiles (two of those being pony cars) produced by American
        automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger
        name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the
        full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger. From model years 1970 to 1974, the
        first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler
        platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components
        with the Plymouth Barracuda. The second generation, from model years
        1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, a coupe
        version of an economical compact car.
      </p>
      <h2>First generation</h2>
      <p>
        Introduced in fall 1969 for the 1970 model year,the Challenger was one
        of two Chrysler E-body cars, the other being the slightly smaller
        Plymouth Barracuda. Positioned to compete against the Mercury Cougar and
        Pontiac Firebird in the upper end of the pony car market segment,it was
        "a rather late response" to the Ford Mustang, which debuted in April
        1964. Even so, Chrysler intended the new Challenger as the most potent
        pony car ever,and like the less expensive Barracuda, it was available in
        a staggering number of trim and option levels, and with virtually every
        engine in Chrysler's inventory.
      </p>
      <p>
        For its introductory model year the Challenger was available in two
        series, Challenger and Challenger R/T, and three models, two-door
        hardtop, Special Edition two-door hardtop, or convertible.The base model
        was the Challenger with either an inline-6 or V8 engine. The Special
        Edition hardtop, available on either the base Challenger or on the R/T,
        added a number of appearance, convenience, and comfort features.Produced
        for the 1970 model year only, this more luxurious SE specification
        included as standard a vinyl roof with a "SE" medallions on the pillars,
        a smaller "formal" rear window, leather and vinyl bucket seats, and an
        overhead interior console that contained three warning lights (door
        ajar, low fuel, and seatbelts).The standard engine on the base model was
        a 225 cu in (3.7 L) Straight-6. The standard engine on the higher trim
        models was a 318 cu in (5.2 L) V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor. For 1970,
        the optional engines included the 340 and 383 cu in (5.6 and 6.3 L), as
        well as the 440 and 426 cu in (7.2 and 7.0 L) V8s, all with a standard
        3-speed manual transmission, except for the 290 hp (216.3 kW) 383 cu in.
        engine, which was available only with the TorqueFlite automatic
        transmission. A 4-speed manual was optional on all engines except the
        225 cu in (3.7 L) Inline-6 and the 2-barrel 383 cu in (6.3 L) V8.
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance model was the Challenger R/T (Road/Track), with a 383 cu
        in (6.3 L) "Magnum" V8, rated at 335 hp (250 kW); 300 hp (224 kW) for
        1971, due to a drop in compression. The standard transmission was a
        3-speed manual. Optional R/T engines were the 375 hp (280 kW) 440 cu in
        (7.2 L) Magnum, the 390 hp (291 kW) 440 cu in (7.2 L) Six-Pack and the
        426 cu in (7.0 L) Hemi rated at 425 hp (431 PS; 317 kW) at 5,000 rpm and
        490 lb⋅ft (664 N⋅m) of torque at 4,000 rpm. The R/T was available in
        either the hardtop or convertible. The Challenger R/T came with a Rallye
        instrument cluster that included a 150 mph (240 km/h) speedometer, an
        8,000 rpm tachometer and an oil pressure gauge.The shaker hood scoop was
        not available after 1971.
